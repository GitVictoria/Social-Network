// gobal store (object)
// put stuff into redux using function called -> dispatch
// dispatch starts the redux process (component)
// action (action.js) -> action is an object -> describes what change we want to make in our global redux state
// every action object has property 'type:' -> can be whatever I want to call it whatever I want.
// the function with return - > action creator
// reducer - > (reducers.js) -> function taking pieces of info and puts it in a global redux state
// reducer should be immutably
// Object.aassign = ES5
// spread operator = ES6
